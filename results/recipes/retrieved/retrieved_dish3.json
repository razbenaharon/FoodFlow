In a large bowl combine quinoa with enough cold water to cover by several inches. Stir quinoa to rinse and drain in a fine sieve. Rinse quinoa again under running cold water and drain well.\nIn a large heavy pot heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over moderately high heat and saute scallions until wilted but not browned. Stir in the rinsed quinoa and cook, stirring, until hot about 1 to 2 minutes. Add 1 cup of simmering stock, stirring, until absorbed, about 5 minutes.
