Set aside to cool.\nWhen cool enough to handle, peel eggplant and roughly chop, reserving liquid. Transfer to a large bowl. Mix in remaining ingredients and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve chilled or at room temperature, with pita triangles.\nVariation: Make humus by substituting canned garbanzo beans for the eggplant.",
