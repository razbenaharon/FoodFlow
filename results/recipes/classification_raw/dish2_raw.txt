Here is the categorized output based on the recipe and the provided lists:

```json
{
  "expiring": ["Sea bass", "Heirloom tomatoes", "Parmesan cheese", "Mushrooms", "Dill"],
  "inventory": ["Olive oil", "Basil", "Zucchini", "Garlic", "Black pepper", "Salt"],
  "missing": []
}
``` 

### Explanation:
1. **Expiring**: These are ingredients from the recipe that are listed in the "Expiring items" list.
2. **Inventory**: These are ingredients from the recipe that are in the "Current inventory" but not in the "Expiring items" list.
3. **Missing**: All ingredients in the recipe are accounted for in either the "Expiring" or "Inventory" lists, so there are no missing items.
