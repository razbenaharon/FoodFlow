👋 Welcome to FoodFlow!
You are now simulating operations for 'HaSalon' restaurant in Tel Aviv, owned by chef Eyal Shani.
Our goal is to make smart, sustainable decisions about what to cook, sell, or donate among expiring ingredients.

For each expiring ingredient, the agent will determine the most suitable action:
- 🍽️ Cook: A message will be sent to the chef with today’s special based on this ingredient.
- 🍴 Sell: A message will be sent to a nearby restaurant most likely to purchase it.
- ❤️ Donate: A pickup will be scheduled with a nearby donation center.
