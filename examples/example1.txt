👋 Welcome to FoodFlow!
You are now simulating operations for 'HaSalon' restaurant in Tel Aviv, owned by chef Eyal Shani.
Our goal is to make smart decisions about what to cook, sell, or donate among expiring ingredients.

For each expiring ingredient, the agent will choose the best course of action:
- If cooking: a message will be sent to the chef with today’s special based on this ingredient.
- If selling: a message will be sent to a nearby restaurant that is most likely to buy it.
- If donating: a pickup will be scheduled with a suitable nearby donation center.
